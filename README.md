=========

#####Solves simple substitution ciphers by matching word patterns with a dictionary.

usage: python subsolve.py wordlist-file ciphertext-file

A good wordlist is important for best results. Ideally a wordlist should include every word that could appear in the plaintext, without including too many extraneous words. In particular, I recommend removing uncommon 1, 2, and 3 letter words.
